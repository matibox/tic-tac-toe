# ❌⭕ Enhanced tic-tac-toe in JavaScript

My first JS project done using ES6 classes, that I've learnt recently. It features a modified version of a classical tic-tac-toe game.

#### Rules:
- it's a basic tic-tac-toe game until every player places their icons 3 times
- there can't be more than 6 icons total on the board
- after every icon is placed, now instead of placing the icons, players need to drag the *first* icon they've placed into an empty space on the board
- ... and then the 2nd one etc. until they manage to get 3 icons in a one line (just like in normal tic-tac-toe game)
